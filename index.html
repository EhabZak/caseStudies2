										<h2>Context</h2>

										<div id="subContext">
											<div>
												<p>The purpose of this initiative is to integrate a Universal Search feature into the PayPal mobile
													app,
													aiming to enhance
													the ease and speed for users to locate what they're looking for. This effort supports PayPal's
													broader
													mission of offering
													convenient tools and services that empower users to better manage their financial lives.</p>
												<p>
													In this Case Study, I’ll be evaluating the PayPal ecosystem and user base to determine common
													pain
													points PayPal users have. From there,
													I’ll define an MVP solution that addresses those core pain points. Finally, I’ll set success
													metrics and
													a rollout plan to test our MVP
													solution with a subset of the PayPal user base.

											<h2>Hypothesis:</h2>
											<p><strong> If PayPal adds Universal Search to their mobile app, users will complete
													core tasks faster.</strong></p>
										</section>

									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>Market Research</h2>
										<h3>What Can We Learn from Competitors?</h3>
										<ul id="company">
											<div class="containerVenmo">
												<li><strong>Venmo:</strong> Users can search for people, businesses, and charities from the home
													screen.When users tap on the search bar, the user is navigated to a full Search screen, with
													Name,
													@username as the placeholder.
												</li>
												<img src="./images/Venmo.jpg" alt="venmo">
											</div>
											<div class="containerVenmo">
												<img src="./images/instagram.png">
												<li><strong>Instagram:</strong> Instagram follows a similar pattern. Users can search anything and
													Instagram will return appropriate results. Instagram prompts users with fun, unique search terms
													to
													spark inspiration for what’s possible with their search.

													Once a user actually searches, they land on the Top tab of the search results page. They can
													then
													switch to the Accounts, Audio, Tags, or Places tabs. We can assume these are in order of what
													Instagram believes is most valuable to drive users to.</li>
											</div>
											<li><strong>A few common themes across all of these apps</strong>
												<ul>
													<li>The Search bar is typically on the Home tab/first tab and is at the top of the screen. It
														grounds the user and sets the stage that they can find whatever they need from it. </li>
													<li>The Search bar placeholder text copy is usually high level: “Search for anything” or
														“Search” in order to not box the user into thinking they can only search for one thing.</li>
													<li>The empty states may include prompts “Try searching for” or “Search ‘woodworking’” to spark
														ideas in the user’s brain about what they may be able to search</li>
													<li>Most Search experiences support many different categories of results.</li>
												</ul>
												These platforms also implement universal search features,
												allowing users to easily find what they need across various categories.
											</li>
										</ul>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>The Audience</h2>
										<p><strong>Who Uses PayPal?</strong> At a high level, there are two main users
											of PayPal: <strong>individuals</strong> and <strong>merchants</strong>. This initiative is focused
											specifically
											on adding Universal Search to the PayPal mobile app, not the PayPal Business
											app. This means we’ll focus on our <strong>individuals</strong> user base.</p>
										<h3>individual PayPal Users:</h3>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Age:</strong> 24% of PayPal’s US users are 58 years or older (~48M users).</li>
											<li><strong>Transaction Frequency:</strong> The average user transacts 45 times per year.</li>
											<li><strong>Location:</strong> Majority of users are in the United States.</li>
											<h3><strong>Use Cases of PayPal:</strong> </h3>
											<ol>
												<li>Securely pay online with purchase protection</li>
												<li>Pay internationally without converting currency</li>
												<li>Pay for subscriptions</li>
												<li>Transfer money between friends/family</li>
												<li>Link multiple payment methods</li>
												<li>Defer payments with PayPal Credit </li>
												<li>Get/link Loyalty cards</li>
												<li>Buy, sell, and securely hold cryptocurrencies with PayPal</li>
												<li>Save with high yield savings</li>
												<li>Get cash back on deals</li>
												<li>Donate to a charity</li>
												<li>Create a fundraiser </li>
												<li>Get a debit card</li>
												<li>Send invoices/estimates</li>
												<li>Cash pickup / reload phone</li>
											</ol>
											<p>Without explicit usage data around the use cases listed above, we can make an assumption
												based on UI prominence that the two primary Individual user use cases are:
											<ul>
												<li>Sending and requesting money</li>
												<li>Managing transactions with individuals and merchants</li>

											</ul>
											</p>
											<p>To design the most impactful Universal Search feature, we’ll solve core pain points for
												a target user segment based on these primary use cases. To summarize, we’ll be focusing
												on users who:
											<ul>
												<li>Are over the age of 58</li>
												<li>Live in the United States</li>
												<li>Send money, request money, and manage their transaction history</li>
											</ul>
											<p>Our Universal Search solution will ultimately provide value for all PayPal users (in the US and
												globally, and under the age of 58),
												and cover various use cases, but solving core pain points for this user segment is table stakes.
											</p>
											<p><strong>Why?</strong> A user within this older demographic (which makes up about a quarter of our
												US user base) may
												not have as easy of a time adopting new search functionality (Source) – so if we can build a
												solution that works for them, expanding to younger demographics will be easier. Additionally,
												because we’ve observed increasing growth amongst users over 50, we need to ensure our solution
												works well for these users. (Source) Finally, these core use cases are done by almost all PayPal
												users so if we can solve pain points surrounding them, we will be able to provide value to a
												large
												percentage of our user base.</p>

											</p>
										</ul>

									<section>
										<h2>User Insights: Identifying Pain Points</h2>
										<p>Research uncovered several pain points for PayPal users, particularly for those over 58:</p>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>Finding Contacts:</strong> Struggling to find contacts, to request money from or send money
												to
												<blockquote>
													<ul>
														<li>The person may not be a PayPal user yet</li>
														<li>The person may only be searchable in PayPal’s database by contact info the user doesn’t
															have</li>
														<li>The person’s name may be different on PayPal compared to how the user knows them</li>
													</ul>
												</blockquote>
											</li>

											<li><strong>Finding Transaction:</strong> Hard time sifting through a lot of transactions to find the
												one they want</li>
											<blockquote>
												<ul>

													<li>There may be older transactions that don’t appear on the Home tab or too far down on the
														Wallet -> Activity tab</li>
													<li>Users may want to find transactions by different criteria (date vs name vs amount)</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<li><strong>Finding Specific Transactions in History:</strong> It takes a long time to see all past
												history with a specific individual or merchant</li>
											<blockquote>
												<ul>

													<li>Seeing history with a specific merchant can take 4-5 clicks to get to</li>
													<li>Users may not know exactly how to get to the merchant</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<li><strong>Typing Confusion:</strong> Not knowing what they can type in to find a person (email, phone,
												name, etc.)</li>
											<blockquote>
												<ul>

													<li>Users may spell emails wrong</li>
													<li>Users may enter phone numbers differently than how PayPal is expecting them</li>
													<li>The person may have a different name than how the user is searching (ex: Sam vs Samuel)
													</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>
											<li><strong>Navigation Confusion:</strong> Not knowing where to go on their PayPal app to find what they
												need</li>
											<blockquote>
												<ul>

													<li>User may not know they need to navigate to a specific tab to access certain
														information/features</li>
													<li>Users may go to one tab thinking they’ll find what they need just to later discover it was
														in another area of the app</li>
												</ul>
											</blockquote>

										<h2>User Journey</h2>
										<p><strong>How does a PayPal user find a transaction with someone?</strong> In general, the information
											architecture of the PayPal app is confusing. Because PayPal is trying to
											grow various parts of their business (Crypto, Savings, Merchant Deals) core user flows are buried.</p>

										<p>
										<h3>Natalie, 65</h3>
										<p><strong>Scenario:</strong> Natalie sends money to her daughter Amy every couple of weeks through PayPal.
											Natalie's husband asks her how much she send a couple of months ago.</p>
										<p><strong>Natalie's Expectations:</strong>
										<ul>
											<li>I can easily find old transactions</li>
											<li>I can easily see my history with Amy</li>
											<li>This should only take a couple of seconds</li>
										</ul>

									<section>
										<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
										<p><strong>From this research, we can conclude the following:</strong>
										<ul>
											<li>PayPal is growing in popularity amongst an older demographic as a way to send and receive money.
											</li>
											<li>It’s common for native apps to have a universal search bar on the home screen to enable users to
												quickly get to what they need.</li>
											<li>Right now, core use cases like finding a contact or transaction are very difficult and time
												consuming to complete .</li>
										</ul>
										</p>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>The Problem</h2>
										<p>PayPal’s current app lacks an easy and fast way for users to find what they need. Core actions like
											finding contacts or transactions take too long to complete.</p>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>The Goal</h2>
										<p><strong>Decrease the time it takes to complete core actions on the PayPal app by empowering users to
												search
												through all content and features available to them from one search box.</strong></p>
										<p>We will be focusing on solving these core pain points through our Universal Search feature.
											By helping users find contacts to request/send money, find and manage transactions, and more
											quickly navigate through the app, we’re helping execute on PayPal’s overall mission to make
											it more convenient to transact and control their financial lives.</p>

									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>Feature Prioritization & MVP Definition</h2>
										<p><strong>What should be included in the MVP?</strong></p>
										<p>Creating a Universal Search that encompasses all content across the entire PayPal app
											will be a very big undertaking. In order to ensure it is worth investing resources here,
											we want to start by testing an MVP of Universal Search. If successful, we will continue
											to build out a powerful Universal Search that helps users find contacts, cryptocurrencies,
											and everything in between. </p>
										<p>The feature set for our Universal Search MVP will be limited to an empty state and a results state
											because: </p>
										<ul>
											<li>These states are the fewest required to provide users with context/value and allow us to begin
												learning if Universal
												Search is really solving pain points for the user. </li>
											<li>Additionally, querying multiple data sets across PayPal’s ecosystem at the same time, while
												returning results quickly, will be a big technical challenge/undertaking.
												In an effort to keep scope limited, features like “Auto expand core options”
												mentioned in Future Iterations have been deprioritized from the MVP.</li>
										</ul>
									</section>
									<section>
										<h2>User Stories</h2>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>As a PayPal user, I can search for things from my Home screen</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>We’ll add a Universal Search bar on the Home screen. Tapping on it will open Search autocomplete
													view with keyboard. </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>As a PayPal user on the Search screen, I will have quick access to my top items</strong>
											</li>
											<ul>
												<li>Users will see Individual Contacts they frequently engages with </li>
												<li>Users will see a prompt to request permission to access local phone contacts </li>
												<li>Users will see Merchants they frequently engage with </li>
												<li>Users will see recent transactions</li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>As a PayPal user, I will be able to search for Contacts, Transactions, and Merchants from
													one place</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Autocomplete search for Individual Contacts by: Name (first name, last name, or both),
													Email, Phone Number (normalizing different ways a user could type in number), Username </li>
												<li>Autocomplete search for Merchants you’ve transacted with by Name</li>
												<li>Autocomplete search for Transactions by Name </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>As a PayPal user, I will see the most relevant results when I search</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Dynamic results to visually reflect result types (contacts vs transactions vs merchants) </li>
											</ul>
										</ol>
									</section>
									<section>
										<h2>Final Solutions</h2>
										<p><strong>Universal Search on Home and Search Results update</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>"Search PayPal"used instead of "Name, email, etc" in an effort to
												not box the user into thinking they can only search for contacts. Instead,
												 encourage them to search the entirety of PayPal.</li>
											<li>Your Contacts", "Merchant", and "Transactions" to provide users with context
												 into what they can search</li>
											<li>Results are a mix of contacts, merchants, and transactions based on the Search term.
												Each result "type" has a consistent design element to help the user quickly identify what each result
												is. For example, the person icon next to contact result helps the user identify that that result is a Contact.</li>
											<li>As the user types, results dynamically adjust to best fit the search term. Results that are no longer
												 relevant disappear from the Results list.</li>

										</ul>

									<section>
										<h2>Risks & Tradeoffs</h2>
										<p><strong>What risks would PayPal open themselves up to if they added Universal Search to the app?</strong>
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li><strong>Including the Search bar on the Home screen</strong>
												content.</li>
											<ul>
												<li>By taking up prominent real estate on the Home Screen, we may accidentally
													introduce friction to complete certain actions by pushing the rest of the Home screen
													content/features down. </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Getting permission to access local phone contacts </strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Note: this may have been previously solved in other areas of the app, but
													we will still want to be cognizant of these risks for our Universal Search solution as well.
												</li>
												<li>User privacy concern about syncing user’s contact list & associated data, resulting in users not
													giving permission.</li>
												<li>Technical challenges associated with combining local phone contact information with PayPal’s
													contacts database, all while returning results fast.</li>
												<li>We need to make sure duplicate results aren’t returned which could confuse users. (Seeing two
													exact contacts would confuse the user around which to tap).</li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>MVP not including entire scope of searchable items</strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Our MVP will only allow searching Contacts, Merchants, and Transactions. By not including
													cryptocurrencies for example,
													we may be accidentally training users that this Search bar will always be limited to these
													result types. </li>
												<li>A way to guard against this in the future will be updating the empty state with different result
													types to educate the user. </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Time & resources it’ll take to build, launch, and maintain Universal Search</strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Adding Universal Search to the UX adds another layer of complexity to maintaining the PayPal
													app.
													We have to ensure routing continues to function properly from Search & elsewhere.</li>
												<li>Additionally, to be a true Universal Search, we should eventually support all types of PayPal
													content and features which will create additional work in the future as new PayPal functionality
													is launched.</li>
												<li>Committing to Universal Search means fewer resources can be dedicated to other functionality.
												</li>
											</ul>

										<h2>Measuring Success</h2>
										<h3>North Star Metric</h3>
										<p><strong>Avg Time From App Open → Core Use Case Completion</strong></p>
										<p>If we are solving our user’s main pain points, we should see a decrease in the amount of time it takes
											for users to complete core actions.
											Core Use Case Completion is an umbrella metric measuring users who do one of <strong>sending money,
												requesting money, or viewing a past transaction.</strong></p>

										<h3>Secondary</h3>
										<p><strong>These secondary metrics will help us determine if there are different areas of the Universal
												Search feature we may be able to improve/optimize. </strong></p>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>App open → core use case completion rate within a session </strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Does saving time to reach a contact/transaction/etc with Universal Search get more users to
													complete core use cases?</li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Home view → search start rate </strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>How many users are even starting searches?</li>
												<li>Is the Search bar appealing and clear enough to prompt users to search? </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Search start → abandon rate </strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>How many users begin searching for something and then abandon? </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Search start → result click rate </strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>How many users begin searching and select a result? </li>
												<li>Does this differ by result type? (Ex: finding transactions takes more time than contacts) </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Average time between search start → result click </strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>How long does it take to select a result? (Is the UI simple enough for users to quickly select
													what they want to select) </li>
												<li>Does this differ by result type?</li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Average clicked search result index value </strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>What is the average position users are clicking on results? If it’s low (1-2) then our
													autocomplete
													is working very well. If it’s a couple results down (3-6) our autocomplete is performing okay.
													If it’s higher, we probably need to optimize our algorithm to return better results. </li>

											</ul>
											<li><strong>Number of WAUs using Search</strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Are more users using Search over time? </li>

											</ul>
											<li><strong>Breakdown of result type clicks</strong> </li>
											<ul>

												<li>Are users just searching for one type of content (contacts for example) or are they also
													searching for transactions and merchants? </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Search start → no results rate</strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>How often are we failing to find any results for the user? </li>
												<li>Are there any commonalities for search terms that are causing no results to appear? </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>App open → contact permission given rate </strong> </li>
											<ul>

												<li>Are most users giving us permission to access their contacts? If not, can we message it in a
													better way to increase this metric?</li>
											</ul>
										</ol>
										<h3>Counter Metrics</h3>
										<p><strong>Since our Universal Search bar will be on the Home tab and take up prime real estate, we want
												to ensure we are not unintentionally
												hurting other core metrics. To monitor this, we will track: </strong></p>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>Decreased new user account completion rate </strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Are fewer new users completing their account set up because the Universal Search bar is
													pushing down critical onboarding steps?</li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong> Decreased product expansion rates</strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Are fewer users signing up for PayPal savings, buying Crypto, or signing up for merchant
													deals? </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>Decreased average GMV transacted </strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Are we unintentionally decreasing the amount of money processed through PayPal by
													introducing the Search
													bar and taking up Home screen real estate?</li>
											</ul>
										</ol>

										<h2>Launch & Go-To-Market Strategy</h2>
										<h3>A/B Test Universal Search</h3>
										<p>To ensure we are improving the PayPal app’s user experience by introducing Universal Search, we will be
											testing
											this feature. We will A/B test our MVP with a small group of new and existing users within our target
											user
											segment. </p>

										<ul>
											<li><strong>Versions:</strong> </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Control: Current PayPal app without Universal Search (Start at 90% of audience)</li>
												<li>Variant: PayPal app with Universal Search (Start at 10% of audience)</li>

											</ul>
											<li><strong> Audience: </strong>Users who… </li>
											<ul>
												<li>Live in the United States </li>
												<li>Are over the age of 58 </li>
											</ul>

										</ul>
										<li><strong>Primary Metric: </strong></li>
										<ul>
											<li>Average time between app open → core use case completion </li>
											<p>We will be including new users in this experiment to ensure adding a Universal Search bar doesn’t
												negatively impact core account setup / top of funnel metrics. We will be starting the A/B test
												variant at 10% of our target audience so that we can iterate without affecting the majority of
												users in this audience. </p>
											<p>If the results of the A/B test are positive (primary measure of success achieved and no negative
												side effects) we will expand our test cohort to all users in the United States regardless of age.
												If our metrics in the expanded cohort are also positive, we will roll out the MVP to all United
												States users. </p>
											<p>From there, we will begin improving the Universal Search experience by executing additional features
												on the roadmap and eventually expand Universal Search to be supported internationally.</p>
											<p>Note: If our A/B test results are negative, we will investigate potential causes, iterate,
												and re-run the experiment.</p>
										</ul>

										</ul>
										</ul>


									</section>





									<section>
										<h2>Future Iterations</h2>
										<p><strong>What could Universal Search do in the future?</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Auto-expand core options within search results instead of navigating user to new screen</li>
											<li>For example, if a user searches an individual contact and taps on a result, we can prompt them with
												“Send”,
												“Request”, or a “More” option. This will reduce friction to complete a core option and establish
												Universal
												Search as a powerful tool. </li>
											<li>No results state to collect feedback about what the user was trying to search for. (can be used to
												prioritize order of following features) </li>
											<li>Improved result matching (If you search John Doe but the contacts name is James Doe, the contact
												would still show up based
												on last name, despite not being an exact string match)</li>
											<li>Search for Invoices</li>
											<li>Search for Merchants deals by Name</li>
											<li>Search for Cryptocurrencies</li>
											<li>Search for Charities</li>
											<li>Search Transactions in additional ways (ex: date, amount)</li>
											<li>Filter results by category (ex: Invoices, Crypto, etc.), date, etc.</li>
											<li>Additional routes & search terms will be evaluated based on data we can
												gather from early iterations. We will specifically look at users who begin searching, fail and
												abandon.</li>

										</ul>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
										<h3>Summary</h3>
										<p>To recap, I’d recommend A/B testing an MVP of Universal Search with the goal of decreasing the amount of
											time it takes to complete core actions (send money, request money, view/manage transactions). </p>
										<p>This MVP aims to solve core pain points that users in our target user segment face. </p>
										<p>If the test returns positive results, I’d recommend PayPal expands the functionality of
											Universal Search and eventually rolls out the feature globally.</p>

										<h2>Context</h2>
										<p><strong>How do people eat?</strong></p>
										<p>In today's world, people eat in various ways, ranging from less convenient
											to more convenient options. Some people cook unprepared foods while others
											prefer prepared foods that are ready to eat. Uber Eats has already developed
											solutions for three main categories of eating options:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>On-demand restaurant delivery</li>
											<li>Eating out / ordering pickup</li>
											<li>Online grocery delivery</li>
										</ul>
										<p>In this case study, I aimed to answer <strong> or not Uber Eats should build a solution for a 4th way of
												eating: Packaged Meals.</strong></p>

										<h2>The Marketplace</h2>
										<p><strong>Since Uber Eats is a marketplace, we should consider how Packaged Meals could affect other user
												groups. </strong></p>

										<p class="marketlabel"><strong>Packaged Meal Brands</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Lower CAC</li>
											<li>Increased revenue from new distribution channel </li>
											<li>Potential cost savings through Uber’s delivery network and infrastructure</li>

										</ul>
										<p><strong>Risks / disadvantages</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Technical integration with Uber Eats</li>
											<li>Smaller margins for new users who may have joined in other ways </li>
											<li>Lower ARPU (users may split meals between Restaurants, Groceries, Packaged Meals)</li>
											<li>Sudden increase in demand, leading to difficulty fulfilling</li>
										</ul>

										<p class="marketlabel"><strong>Delivery Couriers</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>New orders flowing in daily/weekly</li>

										</ul>
										<p><strong>Risks / disadvantages</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Potentially fewer overall orders, if frequent purchases consildate multiple orders into packaged
												meal subscription</li>
											<li>Package differences: </li>
											<ul>

												<li>Heavier (ice packs & insulation) with need to maintain temperature during transit</li>
												<li>Bigger (user could order up to 12 meals at once)</li>
											</ul>
											<li>Distribution centers may not be in city centers, causing Couriers to travel farther </li>

										</ul>

										<p class="marketlabel"><strong>Restaurants & Grocery Stores</strong></p>
										<p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Higher WAUs picking their Packaged Meals leading to more Restaurant & Grocery store impressions
											</li>
											<li>Potentially higher number of Uber One members redeeming benefits with Restaurants & Grocery stores
											</li>
											<li>Restaurants could offer their own packaged meal plans. 41% of consumers would be interested
												in meal kits from their favorite restaurants. (Source: <a
													href="https://www.fundera.com/resources/food-delivery-statistics">Fundera by NerdWallet</a>)
											</li>
										</ul>
										<p><strong>Risks / disadvantages</strong></p>
										<ul>
											<li>Packaged Meal orders may cannibalize total orders from Restaurants and Grocery stores</li>
											<li>Fewer repeat customers because of additional cheaper option. </li>
										</ul>

									<div class="big-takeaway">
										<h2>Key Takeaway</h2>
										<p>Uber Eats users are very similar to Packaged Meal delivery users.</p>
										<ol>
											<li>They’re similar in age and share the same attitude when it comes to eating food: they want to avoid
												grocery
												shopping and seek easy, cost-effective, and time-saving options. </li>
											<li>They’re used to similar ordering flows.</li>
											<li>The Heat & Eat market is projected to continue expanding at a high rate, meaning there’s likely
												already high demand
												from Uber Eat’s existing user base for this type of food.</li>
											<p>Also, there are enough advantages for Packaged Meal companies to partner with Uber Eats as a new
												distribution channel. </p>
											<p><strong> TLDR: Uber Eats users & Packaged Meal companies can benefit from a new Packaged Meals
													offering.</strong> </p>

										<h2>The Goal</h2>
										<p>Increase average orders per user per week by introducing Packaged Meals into the Uber Eats experience.
										</p>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>Feature Prioritization & MVP Definition</h2>
										<p><strong>What should be included in the MVP?</strong></p>
										<p>For a successful pilot to be run of Packaged Meals, the following user stories are required to build.</p>
										<ol>
											<li><strong> As an Uber Eats user, I want to explore Packaged Meal partners, so that I can decide which
													one to order with.</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Because this is a completely new meal-type that will be offered within Uber Eats, users need an
													extremely easy / visible
													way to explore Packaged Meal partners like Freshly to learn about the offering.</li>
											</ul>

											<li><strong>As an Uber Eats user, I can select a Packaged Meal brand, the meals I want, and a delivery
													date, so that I can order meals.</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Uber Eats users need a way to choose the Packaged Meal partner, coordinate how many meals they
													want and what
													those meals are, as well as select a delivery day and time.</li>
											</ul>

											<li><strong>As an Uber Eats user, I can see the status of my Packaged Meal order, so that I can plan
													accordingly.</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Uber Eats users need to see information about their order like what they ordered, when it will
													arrive, and if they need to take any special steps to prepare for the order.</li>
											</ul>

											<li><strong>As a Packaged Meal company, I can sync meal types, availability, and schedules
													with Uber Eats so that Uber Eats users can order meals.</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Uber Eats needs to build an integration between them and the Packaged Meal brands to ensure meal
													information is properly and continuously synced. The only way Packaged Meals are able to be
													delivered at such a cheap cost is by proper planning with large amounts of data. </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>As a Packaged Meal company, I can ingest new orders from Uber Eats so that I can fulfill
													those orders.</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Packaged Meal companies need to know what meals are ordered for which customer so they can
													produce them and ship them accordingly. </li>
											</ul>
											<li><strong>As an Uber Eats Delivery Courier, I have all the information and supplies necessary to
													deliver Packaged Meals.</strong></li>
											<ul>
												<li>Couriers may need special bags / ice packs to deliver these types of frozen packages meals.
													There should be systems in place to coordinate deliveries with the Couriers. </li>
											</ul>

										</ol>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>Solutions Explored</h2>
										<p>What options do we have to offer and fulfill Packaged Meal on Uber Eats?</p>
										<ol>
											<li><strong>Schedule</strong></li>
											<p>Users can schedule a batch of packaged meals to be delivered a few days in the future.</p>
											<p><strong>Order Types: </strong>Batch Subscription or Batch Single Order</p>
											<p><strong>Fulfillment Options:</strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Brand:</strong> Uber wouldn’t be involved in fulfillment, just the ordering experience.
													Orders would be fulfilled by existing methods (Fedex, UPS, etc.)</li>
												<li><strong>Uber:</strong> To transport meals from the cooking center to the distribution center in
													a target city,
													the Uber Freight network can be utilized. Local Uber couriers can be tasked with picking up and
													delivering the
													batches of meals based on a predetermined schedule. To optimize the process, the Logistics team
													can work with the
													couriers to route them to the distribution center on their way into the city centers from their
													homes. This ensures
													that the delivery process is both efficient and timely. Additionally, to minimize waste, Uber
													couriers can be provided
													with reusable ice packs that they can return to the distribution center after each delivery.
												</li>

											</ul>
											<li><strong>On-Demand</strong></li>
											<p>Users can order packaged meals for delivery within ~30 minutes.</p>
											<p><strong>Order Types: </strong>Single, Batch, or Add-On</p>
											<p><strong>Fulfillment Options: </strong></p>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Uber:</strong>To ensure that meal inventory is managed efficiently, it is important to
													predict which meals
													will be selected in target cities on a weekly basis. This information can then be used to
													determine an appropriate
													amount of inventory to take on. To transport the meals from the cooking center to the
													distribution center in the
													target city, the Uber Freight network can be utilized. Local Uber couriers can be assigned to
													pick up and deliver single,
													batch, or add-on orders, based on the predicted demand. To optimize the process, the Logistics
													team can work with the
													couriers to route them to the distribution center on their way into the city centers from their
													homes. This ensures that
													the delivery process is both efficient and timely. </li>

										<h2>What would the User Experience look like?</h2>
										<p>We will start with a pilot and iterate based on learnings before expanding further.</p>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>Measuring Success</h2>
										<p><strong>Separate from Restaurants</strong></p>
										<p>In an effort to not cannibalize Restaurant orders, Packaged Meal options will be a distinct flow in the
											app.</p>
										<p><strong>Transparent, simple, and educational</strong></p>
										<p>At each step, we’ll explain this new ordering concept to users and guide them to order.</p>
										<div id="userExperience">
											<img src="./images/userexpwilllook1.png" alt="user experience1">

										</div>
										<p><strong>Message the benefits</strong></p>
										<p>Throughout the funnel, we’ll want to message the benefits of subscribing to a Packaged Meal plan on Uber
											Eats.</p>
										<p><strong>Use common components</strong></p>
										<p>For parts of the ordering funnel that are similar to Restaurant ordering, we can use existing components
											and patterns.</p>
										<div id="userExperience">
											<img src="./images/userexpwilllook23.png" alt="user experience2">

										</div>

									</section>

									<section id="phased">
										<h2>Launch and GTM Strategy</h2>
										<p><strong>Phased rollout of Packaged Meals</strong> </p>
										<P>We will start the phased rollout with a pilot. Throughout the pilot, we’ll be in “learn and iterate”
											mode.
											After we prove out the concept and work out the kinks, we will begin expanding.</P>

										<img src="./images/phasedrollout.png" alt="phased rollout">
										<p><strong>Who is involved?</strong> </p>
										<P>Launching a Packaged Meals pilot will involved various teams across Uber - with deep involvement from our
											Product/Engineering teams, Logistics, Operations, Customer Support, Data Science, Legal, Partnerships,
											and more.</P>
										<p><strong>Education</strong> </p>
										<P>We’ll work with a variety of team members to educate internal stakeholders (support, marketing, data
											science, etc.)
											and external stakeholders (couriers, packaged meal brands) about the packaged meals product & nuances.
										</P>
									</section>

									<section>
										<h2>Measuring Success</h2>
										<p><strong>Pilot Metrics</strong> </p>
										<p ><strong>North Star Metric:</strong> Average Orders Per User Per Week </p>

										<P>If successful, we should see an increased Average Order Per User Per Week value because
											Uber Eats users are ordering more meals throughout the week.</P>
										<p><strong>Leading Indicators</strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Packaged Meal Brand Impressions</li>
											<li>Packaged Meal Funnel Conversion Rate</li>
											<li>New Packaged Meal Subscriptions Per Week</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Lagging Indicators</strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>ARPU Per Month</li>
											<li>3 Month User Retention</li>
										</ul>

										<p><strong>Counter Metrics</strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Average Restaurant Orders Per Week</li>
											<li>Average Grocery Store Orders Per Week</li>
										</ul>
										<P>One potential unintended side effect of offering Packaged Meals is that Uber Eats users order
											fewer times at Restaurants and Grocery Stores because they are getting more cheap meals with a
											Packaged Meal subscription. This could result in Restaurant and Grocery Store partners leaving
											Uber Eats which would be very detrimental to the Marketplace. We should monitor these metrics closely.
										</P>

										<p><strong>Monitoring Metrics</strong> </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Packaged Meal Subscription Start Error Rate </li>
											<li>Number of Daily “0 meals available” Error</li>
											<li>Packaged Meal Order Send Error Rate</li>
											<p>These error-related metrics will help us quickly identify if we need to fix a core part of the
												Packaged
												Meal flow. Whether it’s starting a subscription, if we end up offering 0 meals to users, or if we
												can’t
												properly send orders to our Packaged Meal partners.
											</p>

										<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
										<p><strong>Summary</strong> </p>
										<P>n this case study, the primary objective was to determine if introducing Packaged Meals as a fourth meal
											type on Uber Eats could potentially increase user retention. My initial hypothesis suggested that
											offering
											Packaged Meals would increase retention rates for Uber Eats, catering to consumers who are seeking
											affordable, convenient, and healthy meal options.</P>
										<P>Currently, Packaged Meals are delivered via UPS or FedEx, which does not provide an optimal user
											experience.
											Customers have no control over the delivery time, and their food for the week could be at risk of theft.
											Uber Eats, however, is uniquely positioned to significantly improve the fulfillment process for this
											type of meal. By leveraging their existing infrastructure, Uber Eats can create a differentiated,
											seamless
											experience that adds substantial value for users, encouraging them to order through the platform instead
											of directly from Packaged Meal brands.</P>
										<P>As a Product Manager at Uber, I would recommend conducting a small-scale pilot test in a specific market
											to evaluate the impact of introducing Packaged Meals on the identified north star metric: Average Orders
											Per Week Per User. This would provide valuable insights into the viability of this addition to the Uber
											Eats ecosystem and inform future expansion decisions.</P>
